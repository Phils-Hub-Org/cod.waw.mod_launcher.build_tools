Building sounds steps:
    (1):
        place your sound in 'waw_root_dir/sound_assets/Raw/sound/<<your custom folder[]>>/your sound.wav'
        e.g, 'waw_root_dir/sound_assets/Raw/sound/custom/fire.wav'
    (2):
        either create your own soundalias.csv file or use the placeholder (custom_sound.csv) one provided and modify the path as needed.
        place said file in 'waw_root_dir/raw/soundaliases/<<your soundalias.csv file>>
        e.g, 'waw_root_dir/raw/soundaliases/custom_sound.csv'
        
NOTE (mod.csv):
    (1):
        When you've successfully built the sound, it will appear in 'waw_root_dir/raw/sound/<<your custom folder>>/your sound.wav'
        e.g, 'waw_root_dir/raw/sound/custom/fire.wav'
    
    (2):
        In order to rebuild the same sound from the same folder, you will need to first delete the previously converted sound file from 'waw_root_dir/raw/sound/<<your custom folder>>/your sound.wav'

    (3):
        You do not need to place the following in the mod launchers mod.csv section in order to build a sound, to play a sound in-game sure, but not to just build a sound.
        // identifier | soundalias.csv filename | level name (i think)? | all_sp (not sure, but is needed i believe)
        // sound,custom_sound,,all_sp
